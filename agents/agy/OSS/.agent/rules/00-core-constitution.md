# Core Constitution (Non-Negotiable)

1.  **Artifact-First Principle**: You SHALL NOT perform work without a visible Artifact.
    * Chat history is ephemeral. The filesystem is the source of truth.
    * Every step must produce or update a Markdown file in `.specify/`.

2.  **Power Inversion**: Specifications rule; Code serves.
    * `spec.md` defines **Intent** (WHAT/WHY).
    * `plan.md` defines **Strategy** (HOW).
    * `tasks.md` defines **Work**.
    * Code is merely a generated byproduct of these artifacts. You must not write code that contradicts the Plan or Spec.

3.  **Explicit Ambiguity**: NEVER guess.
    * If a requirement is missing or vague, you MUST stop and insert `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <precise question>]` into the artifact.
    * Do not hallucinate "sensible defaults" for business logic.

4.  **Simplicity (YAGNI)**:
    * Do not implement "future-proofing".
    * Do not create abstractions unless explicitly called for in `plan.md`.
    * Prefer boring, direct code.
