# GitHub Interaction Protocol

## 1. Issue Synchronization
* **Source of Truth**: `tasks.md` is the absolute master.
* **One-Way Sync**: You typically create GitHub Issues *from* tasks.md.
* **Idempotency**: Before creating an issue for "Task-01", you MUST search existing issues to see if it already exists. Do not create duplicates.
* **Linking**: When you create an issue, you MUST update `tasks.md` to include the Issue URL next to the task item.
    * Example: `- [ ] P1-T01: Fix flag parsing (Issue #42)`

## 2. Pull Requests
* **Content Authority**: The PR Body MUST come from the `PR.<repo>.md` artifact generated by the `/pr` workflow. Do not improvise the description.
* **Scope**: A PR must map to exactly one `<feature-id>`.

## 3. Safety Limits
* **Rate Limit**: Do not create more than 5 issues in a single batch without asking for confirmation.
* **Repository**: NEVER interact with a repository that does not match `git config --get remote.origin.url`.
